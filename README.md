This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Creating a new project

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest nextjs-dashboard --use-npm --example "https://
github.com/vercel/next-learn/tree/main/dashboard/starter-example"

```

This command uses create-next-app, a Command Line Interface (CLI) tool that sets up a Next.js application for you. In the command above, you're also using the --example flag with the starter example for this course.

## Folder structure

**/app:** Contains all the routes, components, and logic for your application, this is where you'll be mostly working from.
**/app/lib:** Contains functions used in your application, such as reusable utility functions and data fetching functions.
**/app/ui:** Contains all the UI components for your application, such as cards, tables, and forms. To save time, we've pre-styled these components for you.
**/public:** Contains all the static assets for your application, such as images.
**/scripts/:** Contains a file that you'll use to populate your database in a later chapter.

Config Files: You'll also notice config files such as next.config.js at the root of your application. Most of these files are created and pre-configured when you start a new project using create-next-app.

**app/lib/placeholder-data.js:** Each JavaScript object in the file represents a table in your database. For example, for the invoices table:

**/app/lib/definitions.ts:** Here, we manually define the types that will be returned from the database.

By using **TypeScript**, you can ensure you don't accidentally pass the wrong data format to your components or database, like passing a string to amount instead of a number.

### If you're a TypeScript developer

- Next.js detects if your project uses TypeScript and automatically installs the necessary packages and configuration. Next.js also comes with a TypeScript plugin for your code editor, to help with auto-completion and type-safety.

- We're manually declaring the data types, but for better type-safety, we recommend tools like Prisma, which automatically generates types based on your database schema.

## Running the development server

Run npm i or npm install to install the project's packages.

```bash
npm install
```

Followed by npm run dev to start the development server.

```bash
npm run dev
```

```npm run dev``` starts your Next.js development server on port 3000. Let's check to see if it's working. Open <http://localhost:3000> on your browser.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## CSS Styling

In this chapter...

Here are the topics weâ€™ll cover

- How to add a global CSS file to your application.

- Two different ways of styling: Tailwind and CSS modules.

- How to conditionally add class names with the clsx utility package.

### Global styles

**/app/ui:** If you look inside folder, you'll see a file called global.css. You can use this file to add CSS rules to all the routes in your application - such as CSS reset rules, site-wide styles for HTML elements like links, and more.
You can import global.css in any component in your application, but it's usually good practice to add it to your top-level component. In Next.js, this is the root layout (more on this later).

> **/app/layout.tsx**

```TypeScript
import '@/app/ui/global.css';
```

If you take a look inside global.css, you'll notice some @tailwind directives.

```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

### Tailwind

Tailwind is a CSS framework that speeds up the development process by allowing you to quickly write utility classes directly in your JSX markup. The CSS styles are shared globally, but each utility is singularly focused and applied to each individual element. This means you don't have to worry about style collisions, maintaining separate stylesheets, or your CSS bundle size growing as your application grows.

When you use create-next-app to start a new project, Next.js will ask if you want to use Tailwind. If you select yes, it will automatically install the necessary packages and configure Tailwind in your application.

If you look at /app/page.tsx, you'll see that we're using Tailwind classes in the example.

```tsx
<div className="h-0 w-0 border-b-[30px] border-l-[20px] border-r-[20px] border-b-black border-l-transparent border-r-transparent"/>
```

### CSS Modules

If you prefer writing traditional CSS rules or keeping your styles separate from your JSX, CSS Modules are a great alternative.

CSS Modules allow you to scope CSS to a component by automatically creating unique class names, so you don't have to worry about name collisions.
Here's how you could create the same shape from the quiz above using CSS modules.

> **app/ui/home.module.css**

```css
.shape {
  height: 0;
  width: 0;
  border-bottom: 30px solid black;
  border-left: 20px solid transparent;
  border-right: 20px solid transparent;
}
```

> Provide a way to make CSS classes locally scoped to components by default, enabling better modularity and reducing the risk of styling conflicts.

### Library clsx

There may be cases where you may need to conditionally style an element based on state or some other condition.

- Suppose that you want to create an InvoiceStatus component which accepts status. The status can be 'pending' or 'paid'.
- If it's 'paid', you want the color to be green. If it's 'pending', you want the color to be gray.

You can use clsx to conditionally apply the classes, like this:

```tsx
import clsx from 'clsx';
 
export default function InvoiceStatus({ status }: { status: string }) {
  return (
    <span
      className={clsx(
        'inline-flex items-center rounded-full px-2 py-1 text-sm',
        {
          'bg-gray-100 text-gray-500': status === 'pending',
          'bg-green-500 text-white': status === 'paid',
        },
      )}
    >
    // ...
)}
```

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
