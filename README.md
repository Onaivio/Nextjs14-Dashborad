This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Creating a new project

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest nextjs-dashboard --use-npm --example "https://
github.com/vercel/next-learn/tree/main/dashboard/starter-example"

```

This command uses create-next-app, a Command Line Interface (CLI) tool that sets up a Next.js application for you. In the command above, you're also using the --example flag with the starter example for this course.

## Folder structure

**/app:** Contains all the routes, components, and logic for your application, this is where you'll be mostly working from.
**/app/lib:** Contains functions used in your application, such as reusable utility functions and data fetching functions.
**/app/ui:** Contains all the UI components for your application, such as cards, tables, and forms. To save time, we've pre-styled these components for you.
**/public:** Contains all the static assets for your application, such as images.
**/scripts/:** Contains a file that you'll use to populate your database in a later chapter.

Config Files: You'll also notice config files such as next.config.js at the root of your application. Most of these files are created and pre-configured when you start a new project using create-next-app.

**app/lib/placeholder-data.js:** Each JavaScript object in the file represents a table in your database. For example, for the invoices table:

**/app/lib/definitions.ts:** Here, we manually define the types that will be returned from the database.

By using **TypeScript**, you can ensure you don't accidentally pass the wrong data format to your components or database, like passing a string to amount instead of a number.

### If you're a TypeScript developer

- Next.js detects if your project uses TypeScript and automatically installs the necessary packages and configuration. Next.js also comes with a TypeScript plugin for your code editor, to help with auto-completion and type-safety.

- We're manually declaring the data types, but for better type-safety, we recommend tools like Prisma, which automatically generates types based on your database schema.

## Running the development server

Run npm i or npm install to install the project's packages.

```bash
npm install
```

Followed by npm run dev to start the development server.

```bash
npm run dev
```

```npm run dev``` starts your Next.js development server on port 3000. Let's check to see if it's working. Open <http://localhost:3000> on your browser.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## CSS Styling

In this chapter...

Here are the topics we‚Äôll cover

- How to add a global CSS file to your application.

- Two different ways of styling: Tailwind and CSS modules.

- How to conditionally add class names with the clsx utility package.

### Global styles

**/app/ui:** If you look inside folder, you'll see a file called global.css. You can use this file to add CSS rules to all the routes in your application - such as CSS reset rules, site-wide styles for HTML elements like links, and more.
You can import global.css in any component in your application, but it's usually good practice to add it to your top-level component. In Next.js, this is the root layout (more on this later).

> **/app/layout.tsx**

```TypeScript
import '@/app/ui/global.css';
```

If you take a look inside global.css, you'll notice some @tailwind directives.

```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

### Tailwind

Tailwind is a CSS framework that speeds up the development process by allowing you to quickly write utility classes directly in your JSX markup. The CSS styles are shared globally, but each utility is singularly focused and applied to each individual element. This means you don't have to worry about style collisions, maintaining separate stylesheets, or your CSS bundle size growing as your application grows.

When you use create-next-app to start a new project, Next.js will ask if you want to use Tailwind. If you select yes, it will automatically install the necessary packages and configure Tailwind in your application.

If you look at /app/page.tsx, you'll see that we're using Tailwind classes in the example.

```tsx
<div className="h-0 w-0 border-b-[30px] border-l-[20px] border-r-[20px] border-b-black border-l-transparent border-r-transparent"/>
```

### CSS Modules

If you prefer writing traditional CSS rules or keeping your styles separate from your JSX, CSS Modules are a great alternative.

CSS Modules allow you to scope CSS to a component by automatically creating unique class names, so you don't have to worry about name collisions.
Here's how you could create the same shape from the quiz above using CSS modules.

> **app/ui/home.module.css**

```css
.shape {
  height: 0;
  width: 0;
  border-bottom: 30px solid black;
  border-left: 20px solid transparent;
  border-right: 20px solid transparent;
}
```

> Provide a way to make CSS classes locally scoped to components by default, enabling better modularity and reducing the risk of styling conflicts.

### Library clsx

There may be cases where you may need to conditionally style an element based on state or some other condition.

- Suppose that you want to create an InvoiceStatus component which accepts status. The status can be 'pending' or 'paid'.
- If it's 'paid', you want the color to be green. If it's 'pending', you want the color to be gray.

You can use clsx to conditionally apply the classes, like this:

```tsx
import clsx from 'clsx';
 
export default function InvoiceStatus({ status }: { status: string }) {
  return (
    <span
      className={clsx(
        'inline-flex items-center rounded-full px-2 py-1 text-sm',
        {
          'bg-gray-100 text-gray-500': status === 'pending',
          'bg-green-500 text-white': status === 'paid',
        },
      )}
    >
    // ...
)}
```

## Optimizing Fonts and Images

In the previous chapter, you learned how to style your Next.js application. Let's continue working on your home page by adding a custom font and a hero image.
In this chapter...
Here are the topics we‚Äôll cover

- ‚úèÔ∏è How to add custom fonts with next/font.
- üõ£Ô∏è How to add images with next/image.
- ‚úÖ How fonts and images are optimized in Next.js.

### Why optimize fonts?

Fonts play a significant role in the design of a website, but using custom fonts in your project can affect performance if the font files need to be fetched and loaded.
Cumulative Layout Shift is a metric used by Google to evaluate the performance and user experience of a website. With fonts, layout shift happens when the browser initially renders text in a fallback or system font and then swaps it out for a custom font once it has loaded. This swap can cause the text size, spacing, or layout to change, shifting elements around it.
![Cumulative Layout Shift](https://nextjs.org/_next/image?url=%2Flearn%2Fdark%2Ffont-layout-shift.png&w=1920&q=75&dpl=dpl_9EKEbD7jAviauyTffgoEyAkQSGtP)
Next.js automatically optimizes fonts in the application when you use the next/font module. It does so by downloading font files at build time and hosting them with your other static assets. This means when a user visits your application, there are no additional network requests for fonts which would impact performance.

### Adding a primary font

In your /app/ui folder, create a new file called fonts.ts. You'll use this file to keep the fonts that will be used throughout your application.

Import the Inter font from the next/font/google module - this will be your primary font.
Then, specify what subset you'd like to load. In this case, 'latin':

```tsx
import { Inter } from 'next/font/google';
export const inter = Inter({ subsets: ['latin'] });
```

Finally, add the font to the <body> element in /app/layout.tsx
By adding Inter to the <body> element, the font will be applied throughout your application. Here, you're also adding the Tailwind antialiased class which smooths out the font. It's not necessary to use this class, but it adds a nice touch to your fonts.

```css
.antialiased {
    -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased;
    -moz-osx-font-smoothing: grayscale;
}
```

```tsx
<body className={`${inter.className} antialiased`}>{children}</body>
```

> You can also add fonts to specific elements of your application.

---

### Why optimize images?

Next.js can serve static assets, like images, under the top-level /public folder. Files inside /public can be referenced in your application.
If you look inside the folder, you'll see there's are two images: hero-desktop.png and hero-mobile.png. These two images are completely different, and they'll be shown depending on the user's device is a desktop or mobile.
With regular HTML, you would add an image as follows:

```tsx
    <img src="/hero.png" alt="Screenshots of the dashboard project showing desktop and mobile versions"/>
```

However, this means you have to manually:

- Ensure your image is responsive on different screen sizes.
- Specify image sizes for different devices.
- Prevent layout shift as the images load.
- Lazy load images that are outside the user's viewport.

Instead of manually handling these optimizations, you can use the ```next/image``` component to automatically optimize your images.

### The \<Image\> component

The \<Image\> Component is an extension of the HTML \<img\> tag, and comes with automatic image optimization, such as:

- Preventing layout shift automatically when images are loading.
- Resizing images to avoid shipping large images to devices with a smaller viewport.
- Lazy loading images by default (images load as they enter the viewport).
- Serving images in modern formats, like WebP and AVIF, when the browser supports it.

### Adding the desktop hero image

Let's swap the \<img\> tag for an \<Image\> component.
In your /app/page.tsx file, import the component from next/image. Then, add the image under the comment:

```tsx
    <Image
        src="/hero-desktop.png"
        width={1000}
        height={760}
        className="hidden md:block"
        alt="Screenshots of the dashboard project showing desktop and mobile versions"
    />
```

Here, you're setting the width to 1000 and height to 760 pixels. It's good practice to set the width and height of your images to avoid layout shift, these should be an aspect ratio identical to the source image.

### Adding the mobile hero image

Now it's your turn again! Under the image you've just added, add another <Image> component for the mobile hero.

- The image should have a width of 560 and height of 620 pixels.
- It should be shown on mobile screens, and hidden on desktop.
- You can use Dev Tools to check if the desktop and mobile images are swapped correctly.

```tsx
    <Image
        src="/hero-mobile.png"
        width={560}
        height={620}
        className="block md:hidden"
        alt="Screenshot of the dashboard project showing mobile version"
    />
```
